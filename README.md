## UnityScreenshotComponent
 Take a screenshot in Unity using specified keys and base name.

A script that lets you take a regular size or higher resolution screenshot by using a key press while in play mode.

The basis of the code is from this helpful article at GameDevBeginner: [How to capture the screen in Unity (3 methods)](https://gamedevbeginner.com/how-to-capture-the-screen-in-unity-3-methods/).

I combined a few of the tips and added some helpful features to the code samples in the article.

Once in your scene, you will want to change the default settings to fit your project.  You must set at least one "Screen Shot Key" for the component to work.


Installation:

Place the AppScreenCapture.cs file into the Scripts folder in your Assets.  Then you can add it to a game object in your scene.
